## Students Rise Up

### Overview
Students Rise Up is a clever platform designed to provide students with access to a variety of games that are typically restricted on school computers. The website ingeniously disguises itself as an educational platform by replacing the favicon and title of the web page to mimic legitimate school websites like Springpod. Our goal is to continually expand our library of accessible websites, ensuring students have more options in the future.

### Features
- **Game Library**: Access a wide range of games that aren't blocked on school computers.
- **Disguised Interface**: The website camouflages itself with educational site appearances to avoid detection.
- **Future Expansion**: Plans to add more websites and features to enhance the user experience.

### Contributing
We welcome contributions to help expand and improve Students Rise Up. Feel free to open issues and pull requests.
